# shift

development in progress

#### a resampler
send audio (mic or file) to this effects chain:  
pitch shifter -> lfo panner -> ping-pong delay. 



# todo: 
- when playing dropped file, make sure to account for mono and stereo. 
- reset prest values now that min and maxes have changed
- midi input?
